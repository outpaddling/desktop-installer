Add auto-update-system cron config

https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/macbook-pro-5-1-realtek-alc889a-sound-setup.56061/

Maybe enable speakers and headphone auto-switch?

    dev.hdaa.0.gpio_config="0=set 1=set"
    hw.snd.default_unit=1
    hint.hdaa.0.nid20.config="as=4 seq=15"

Make sure /etc/hosts has a fqdn matching the hostname

    127.0.0.1 localhost.localhost.domain hostname.domain hostname
    same for ::1

List additional video drivers to install
    Server motherboards often have obsolete chipsets

Explain need for wireless drivers

Install anacron?
    one suggestion from vans9@yandex.ru

    I've meant those periodic tasks that are already in /etc/crontab - daily,
    weekly, monthly. They seem to run almost never at desktops, that work on
    daily basis and are switched off at evening. But. the other side of
    enabling the the periodic through anacron is that roots mail will be
    spammed with the periodic reports. To avoid this, there shoud be line
    in periodic.conf making periodic to write it's repots to file, and
    syslod-ng rotating this files and maybe other things should be done.....
    So it's an overtask for the desktop-installer possibly.

Linimon:

There are several structural problems:

 2) the assumption that any port/pkg install failure is fatal.
 3) the lack of correctly determining whether a pkg is available
    to install.

------------------------------------------------------------------

3) is illustrated by the following:

  if fgrep -q FOR_ARCHS $PORTSDIR/$pkg/Makefile

Nope and nope.  Completely bogus test.  If you *are* going to
query port Makefiles the only robust thing is something like:

  (cd $PORTSDIR/$pkg/Makefile && make ARCH=$arch -V IGNORE)

For only thing, I already shortened ONLY_FOR_ARCHS to FOR_ARCHS.
But that is still not correct.

------------------------------------------------------------------

But that's the correct way for _ports_.

For _packages_, which IMVVHO we should in all cases set as default
for users of this script, every possible port install:

  if ! auto-package-installed $pkg && [ -d $PORTSDIR/$pkg ]; then

should be immediately followed by something like:

    rdescr=$(pkg rquery %e $pkg 2> /dev/null || true)
    if [ -z "${rdescr}" ]; then
	printf "Unfortunately, recommended package $pkg is not available for your system.\n"
    else

I can generate a patch for the ones in common_packages().  But it
might be better as a refactoring of install_packages.

I will wait to try that hacking until you say one way or the other.

------------------------------------------------------------------
