desktop-installer
=================

Desktop-installer is a post-install script for configuring a desktop
environment on a stock FreeBSD or NetBSD system.

It facilitates the setup of a complete desktop system much more quickly,
reliably, and securely than manual software installations and configurations.

The end result is a fully functional
graphical environment comparable to GUI-based systems such as
GhostBSD or Ubuntu Linux. However, unlike those systems, desktop-installer
supports *any* desktop environment or window manager and *any* hardware
supported by the operating system.

To use desktop-installer:

1. Perform a minimal FreeBSD or NetBSD installation using the standard installer
2. Install the desktop-installer package:

    FreeBSD: pkg install desktop-installer
    
    NetBSD: pkgin install desktop-installer

3.  Run "desktop-installer"
4.  Carefully follow the instructions on the screen
